# Quadrotor_planning_and_control

This project was done as the part of the course MEAM620 : Advanced Robotics in UPenn. Thi project involves Control and  dynamics of the quadrotor, planning a path through the obstacles using Djikstra's algorithm and A* algorithm. This project also involves localization of the quadrotor using Visual Inertial odometry. 
<br>
The controller was also implemented on a CrazyFlie quadrotor to simulate in the real world.
